summary: A few of the renders I created in blender in 2019

I started learning to use blender my freshman year in highschool. Over the past five years I've developed quite a bit. I started off learning to program in scratch in middle school. Mostly from being bored in class I would try to find things to do to kill time.
[somehting I made in 7th grade](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/15090977/)
Most of the teachers thought I was doing something semi productive and left me alone. Years later I started 3d modeling and animation to learn how to make game assets.

The image above uses photoscans for the humans and some tricks with image textures to achieve the buildings. It's amazing how much more you can create and finish if you have the knowldge and experience. Both of the two renders took somewhere between 10-15 hr to finish, while it probably would have taken me that same amount of time to do the clouds when I first started off. Teaching myself 3d modeling over the years has been one of the major things that has shaped the way I think to this day. And I'm glad my work finally looks passable after all this time. 

Honeslty most of my ambitions for finishing a game fizzled out as I stopped playing video games as other activites took up the time.  And unfortunatley having practive 3d modeling doesn't fully translate to bieng good at CAD. But I still will finish a 3d render over a weekend if I have a suden burst of inspiration.
