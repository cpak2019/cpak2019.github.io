This program was created for the AP comp principals exam (although they didn't really know what it was ðŸ˜…).
The shader uses a 100x1 image as an input and adjusts the color of the scene based on the image. The shader considers every object's distance from the camera (the player) and will choose a corresponding color along the pixel strip based on the distance. The shader then adjusts the color of the object to be closer to that color. The overall effect is a kind of gradient fog effect where objects are tainted with different colors based on their distance away from you. A shader similar to this was used in the 2016 game Firewatch.
