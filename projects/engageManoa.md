The Engage Manoa website is a centralized directory open to UH Manoa students looking for organizations and clubs. UH Manoa is home to many clubs and student organizations. but there isn’t currently a way to browse the different clubs digitally. The only option is the google spreadsheet which lists all of UH Manoa’s registered independent organizations. Engage Manoa is designed to offer an easily accessible online space for students to find up-to-date information regarding all campus organizations and clubs. Users can create a profile and have access to a full directory to find a club or organization based on their interests.

I worked on this website for the group final project for UH Manoa's Software engineering course (ICS 314). Through this project I gained experience creating a website using tools like semantic UI, react, and meteor. I also gained practice writing code to be used by other people and more experience in managing the project time line.

One of the features I implemented on this project was the List Clubs page. I implemented a system so the users can search for clubs based on tags associated with them.
