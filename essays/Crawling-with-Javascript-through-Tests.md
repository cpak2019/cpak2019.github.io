After having used seven other programing languages, picking up one more shouldn't be a challenge right? While this isn't my first time touching Javascript (if messing around in Google Apps Scripts counts), the experience hasn't been too challenging so far. Although dynamically typed variables have already caused some errors. Also, console error commands have been a tad unhelpful. Overall the experience has felt similar to any other programing language. The structure of the language feels the same as java so far, but I haven't descended into the particulars yet.

So far my process for programing in javascript has relied on already existing mental models. I figure out what I want to say then transcribe it into code (often with the help of documentation). When you know a tool well from hundreds of hours of use you figure out how to incorporate it into solutions. I still don't know the javascript well enough for it to influence how I solve problems. I'm still figuring out the rules and the tool. But hopefully, by the end of this course, I'll have used it enough to understand when what the language is good at.

I've always found puzzles interesting. Something about a challenge that offers a bit of what is often meaningless understanding upon completion is fun. Often mathematical proofs, physics problems, and programming assignments are just puzzles. Most fun, but some not. I think this is related to complexity and tediousness of the puzzles. Something too hard is no fun, but neither is something too easy. But easy puzzles can become fun when you add a few arbitrary restrictions. So far the work out of the day (WOD's) has been kinda fun. They've been useful in forcing me to think through the problem and optimize for simplicity. Often there's not necessarily enough time to try a wrong solution. So being forced to think through a quick solution that has to reliably work has been a fun challenge.
