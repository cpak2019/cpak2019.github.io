Software design patterns are described on Wikipedia as: "reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design". My understand is they are essentially templates of solutions for common problems or situations. Whether that be an algorithm, way to structure your program, or some other method. Throughout this semester we have used various design patterns throughout our code (despite not knowing what they are). To name a few we've touched  singltons and publish subscribe, among others. So far I've been using these common design patterns to quickly achieve what I need to in my program. An example being using a singlton to ensure only one instance of a object exists. But now knowing the what they are I think my relationship with them might change.

Having been a TA for highschoolers I'm a bit cynical about this. Design patterns seem like a similar concept to methods in math. An example being a method for solving word problems, middle schoolers learning FOIL'ing equations, or an algorithm to calculate something. It's not a mathematical object, idea, or equation. Its a way to manipulate those things, hence method. I started seeing these things as a sort of crutch. Students start out by learning and memorizing the process. Understanding you use this for this situation, memorizing the situation and how to get the solution and hopefully practice applying. That's what most students seem to do, to little effect seeing their performance.

But the methods are often of little value/importance. It's a step to understanding underlying concepts, which allows you to adjust and modify the template to work for other situations. But this requires understanding of the problem and being able to connect mental model of situation/pattern with others to create something new. In my opinion its somewhat dangerous to teach things like this. I prefer to see concepts taught after a few examples and less emphasis put on the method. But I'm not sure I see that process yet with design patterns. But in the grand scheme of things this field is still in its infancy so it'd be interesting to see if how programing is taught will shift in the same direction I see many math educators going.
