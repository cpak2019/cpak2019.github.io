Software design patterns are described on Wikipedia as: "reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design". My understand is they are essentially templates of solutions for common problems or situations. Whether that be an algorithm, way to structure your program, or some other method. Throughout this semester we have used various design patterns throughout our code (despite not knowing what they are). To name a few we've touched  singltons and publish subscibe, among others. So far I've been using these common design patterns to quickly achieve what I need to in my program. An example being using a singlton to ensure only one instance of a object exists. But now knowing the what they are I think my relationship with them might change.

Having been a TA for highschoolers I'm a bit cynical about this. Design patterns seem similar to

Similar concept to processes in math or other classes that students memorize, like a method for solving word problems or middle schoolers learning FOIL'ing equations
Crutch, start out by learning and memorizing the process understanding you use this for this situation, memorize the situation and solution and apply. That's what most students seem to do, to little effect seeing their performance

More effective to understand why it works and how it works, allows you to adjust and modify the template to work for other situations. Requires understanding of the problem and being able ot connect mental model of situation/pattern with others to create something new/
In my opinion often dangerous to teach things like this. Perfer to see conept taught and less emphasis put on the system and more on concepts
understand in this case may be because sae reusing chunk of code, Publish subscribe pattern
Intreseting how even in college maybe half of the classes arent taught with this principle in mentioned
