Having used HTML for AP CompSci principles in high school, I appreciated semantic ui. It definitely was a lot easier to make things look decent with a minimal amount of work. Working with semantic ui was like just assembling some prebuilt elements of website. Although working with html is still somewhat the same (except you are working with more basic elements). 

I've been somewhat confused by HTML. My understanding is html generally serves as a tool to create a frontend (while you handle logic and other complex things with tools like javascript). Designing websites is definitely more similar to graphic design than programming, but people are still using a programing style tool to try to create designs.

When 3d modeling and animation was first being developed, most of the work was done manually. So when you see early 3d models they were generally created by manually specifying the faces. One of the earliest animated videos was created by Ed Catmull (who would later found Pixar). He created an animation of a hand by drawing triangles over a physical model then manually measuring and entering every point into a computer. Yet over the years, 3d modeling tools have changed over time to be more friendly to the user and better facilitate the process.

HTML is a tool that doesn't really suit what it's making. The tool doesn't help the process and if anything introduces sources of confusion and errors. People don't create 3d models by manually typing out the models stl file, but we still create websites by writing out website elements like code. Even tools to make it easier (like semantic ui) are still working in HTML, and tools that don't use any HTML rely on prebuilt templates that constrain you. To my knowledge, there haven't been improvements to website development tools like there has to 3d modeling tools which is a bit confusing.  Well, not my circus. Not my monkeys.
