Proposal 1: Reciprocity Ring
1. Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
  - A reciprocity ring is a group exercise designed to build connections between team members. The basic idea is to have all of the participants write down something they want or need that they can't necessarily get on their own. This could range from things like learning how to play guitar to getting a meeting with someone in government.  After everyone will go around and leave their contact information next to any of the requests they think they can help with. The goal of this exercise is to create a culture where generosity is the norm. I noticed there isn't much interaction between students across majors or even between students in the same class if they don't already know each other. My hope is a digital version of the reciprocity ring would foster relationships between students by allowing them to solve each other's problems with nonmonetary transactions.
2. Mockup page ideas
  - Landing page
  - User home showing their requests and people who have noted they can help
  - request search
  - Browse requests by category
3. Use case ideas
  - Can be by the teachers at the beginning of the semester to have students in their class get to know each other better.
  - Can be used by students trying to learn a new skill or who need help studying for a test. Can also be used by students who need help or data for their project.
  - Can be used by teachers or TA's needing help to catch up on grading
4. Beyond the basics
- Can add a rating system, recommendation, and point system to participants to filter out trolls or people who are just takers.
- The point system will work by costing users points when they request something. By completing a request you gain those points from the requestee (the amount posted by the requestee plus extra).


Proposal 2: Class-specific wikis
1. Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
  - Upper-division classes often build on topics and concepts taught in other courses. By the time you take the Uperdivision course it may have been years since you encountered that topic. To make matters worse most Wikipedia or other website entries on math or computer science seem to be written in a foreign language for PhD's by PhD's. Wikipedia also gives a brief generalized overview of their topics. This approach doesn't work for concepts that apply to multiple topics. Also for most people, it takes a while to dig through their old notes. Or they may not even have their notes on the topic.
  My proposed solution to this is a wiki created and maintained by students.
2. Mockup page ideas
  - Wiki organized by class, then topics, then concept. Concept pages can be shared under different topic categories, but have a different page for different classes. Example: page on differential equations will look different if you're in a physics class or in a math class but can easily switch between them).
  - Page to add personal notes on subject (able to add tags to help admin review)
  - Page to look at other users notes on that topic
  - Admin page to compile notes on the subject to a curated wiki page
3. Use case ideas
  - Student uses the wiki to brush up on old topics.
  - Students use wiki to review for test
  - Students create their own curated sheet of notes as review for a test.
4. Beyond the basics
  - Functionality requiring students to upload their notes on the class or to help with curation to use the site (to ensure they are doing work to learn in their classes and help keep the website up to date)
