Goodbye my darling. I loved you from the first time I found out about your existence. Although I didn't always take you up, I knew you always had my back. I'm sorry our time together was so short and I'll always miss and love you. Goodbye optional semicolin.

While I think coding standards can be important, some of the details can be trivial. The time spent looking for the red mark, figuring out what the mistake is, and then figuring out where to place the missing space is definitely wasted (and will hopefully be a thing of a past when I figure out how to set up an autostyler). But I think as a whole coding standards are important. Having some standardized set of conventions definitely makes code easier to read. The importance of coding standards is pretty self-evident when you have to help a new programmer with their code ðŸ˜‚. In my experience trying to read code written without any knowledge of coding standards can be like reading an essay from a child who doesn't know about grammar. It definitely makes a difference.

Having taken a few upper-division math courses working with proofs I can see some parallels between proof conventions and coding standards. Both aren't necessarily essential. But it standardizes the work and makes something complicated a bit easier to read by adhering to already familiar structure.  Especially when the code starts to get more complex and you're trying to figure out what's happening. Not having to spend mental energy also trying to figure out how the format is nice. 

Working with coding standards in class hasn't been too difficult. In all of the previous programming classes I've taken, I'd been expected to adhere to some coding style. Usually, there would be an auto styler included (still trying to find one)... But it hasn't been too much of a hassle so far. I'm not sure if coding standards help with learning programming or a new language, but it makes reading code easier which helps.
