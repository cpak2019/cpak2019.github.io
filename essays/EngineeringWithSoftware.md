Most dictionaries define an engineer as someone who designs and builds machines and structures (physical objects). The word originally originated from the word for those who designed and constructed fortifications and weapons. So in a way the term software engineering seems like a paradox. Programming physical systems, that doesn't seem right. On the other hand if you imaginatively interpret it as creating structures using software that seems like a better fit. I think over time out definition of what an engineer is starting to change. With the introduction of digital system solvers and simulations many roles in engineering are staring to change. So I think this definition of engineer is more appropriate for this era.
> Engineer: to plan, build, or manage (something) by using scientific methods
-English Language Learners definition

I like this definition because it essentially encompasses the plethora of different fields of engineering. And software engineers easily fit into this definition. A software engineer creates software systematically. They rely on math and science to solve and verify problems. Really there isn't much of a difference with the other fields of engineering. Topics in software engineering have their equivalents to other fields of engineering despite the two dealing with different mediums.

For example comparing a few ideas in software engineering to mechanical engineering
Functional Programming - parametrical design
Configuration Management - maintenance and modularity
Coding Standards - Documentation
While there isn't a specific term for it to my knowledge we have an equivalent to Development Environments
Design Patterns - existing past examples
And the ideas of ethics, project management, and open source is essentially universal

Weirdly despite the similarities I find software engineers generally don't think them selves as engineers and most engineers (in traditional fields) don't think of themselves as needing or being capable of easily doing the other sides skills. In my experience the process and procedures are essentially the same between fields, just the medium and what you are working with is different.

The world is changing and we are staring to see more engineers who are more capable are able to pull from knowledge in multiple different fields. And honestly if you think of engineering as just a way of working with a certain medium to solve a problem that doesn't seem that strange. Despite mediums being the systematic scientific approach is essentially universal. So for better or worse after this semester of software engineering I think the field isn't unique. You're just engineers working with software.
