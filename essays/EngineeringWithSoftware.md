Most dictionaries define an engineer as someone who designs and builds machines and structures (physical objects). The word originally originated from the word for those who designed and constructed fortifications and weapons. So in a way the term software engineering seems like a paradox. Programming physical systems, that doesn't seem right. On the other hand if you imaginatively interpret it as creating structures using software that seems like a better fit. I think over time out definition of what an engineer is starting to change. With the introduction of digital system solvers and simulations many roles in engineering are staring to change. So I think this definition of engineer is more appropriate.
> Engineer: to plan, build, or manage (something) by using scientific methods

World is changing and more engineers who are more capable are able to pull in multiple different feilds
Programing is just another side of it, to be approached with same engineering mindset
