Having taught myself the basics of programming in middle school, when I was introduced to programming forums in highschool was sorta magical. How can the idea that you have access to the brains of an unfathomable number of people who are way more experienced than you not be a bit magical? But despite having used them countless times for questions, I've never posted a question myself. Part of this is my tendency to ask for help as a near last resort if I can afford the time (as I find you learn a lot more if you figure out the problem yourself and then analyze where your mental models failed then correct them). But the other part is the answer is almost always there. 

After reading [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) I thought the author was missing something. The three main takeaways I had from the article were :
1. Look for an answer before you ask.
2. Think about how you word the question and be polite about it.
3. Have a bit of empathy and an understanding of the system.
While these bits of advice seem obvious it doesn't seem to come naturally to everyone. 

An example being this question posted on stack overflow [today](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63843452/problems-while-adding-mathtype-to-django-ckeditor) . The user is asking for someone to walk him through how to install a plugin as he's encountered difficulties and " I tried a lot but it is not showing" and doesn't give any more information. The topic was downvoted a few times before being closed.
But in a similar question posted two years [ago](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47545940/when-i-run-npm-install-it-returns-with-err-code-eintegrity-npm-5-3-0) has been viewed over 100 thousand times and has 26 answers. While a bit terse the user broke down the steps they have taken, the errors they encountered, and the version they are using. This highlights the differences in responses you can get by just following a few basics guidelines. As a software engineer, it's critical to word your questions well as its the difference of having access to the library of experts or not.
