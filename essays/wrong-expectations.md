title: Wrong Expectations for ICS 314

I'm going to start off saying something I shouldn't, I don't think I'll ever be a software engineer üòÖ. I decided to take this class because it's listed as a prerequisite for ICS 435 (machine learning). But I didn't come in with any expectations. Honestly most software engineering jobs seem like some sick purgatory to me. It's probably related to laziness or maybe the tendency Kurt Vonnegut mentioned:
> ‚ÄúAnother flaw in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance.‚Äù
  
  
Well to be fair for the same reasons the majority of engineering jobs also seem like a version of hell to me. Hence why I'm in this class. 

I don't really have any specific set of skills that I'm trying to learn or experiences that I'm trying to have. Rather I'm trying to learn as much as I can to help me create whatever ideas I come up with. There's some evidence that you're thoughts are limited by thought and previous knowledge. And the reverse seems to be true where some of the most creative ideas are a combination of different influences. I'm in this class the same reason I'm in senior math major classes despite having no desire to pursue either field, to expand my knowledge and vocabulary of concepts.

In terms of what I'd hope to get out of this class, I don't know yet. It's not that I'm not going to put in the effort or not learn (so far I've enjoyed the class setup despite the restrictions from COVID); rather I don't know what I'm missing. I don't know enough about the field to know what skills I'm missing or what I have yet to learn. So I'm going to keep coming to class with an open mind and try to learn as much as I can.
